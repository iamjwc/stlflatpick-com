</a>

<h3><a name="hess">Clay Hess</a></h3>
<p>
  <img src="images/hess.jpg" width="160px" height="120px" />
  Clay Hess is recognized as one of the premier flat-pick
	guitarists in bluegrass music. Clay was 9 when he first heard
	live bluegrass at the Lake Snowden Bluegrass Festival in Albany,
	Ohio. Clay's parents and his older brother played traditional
	country music, so he originally began learning classic country.
	Clay credits his older brother as a big influence on his desire
	to play guitar, though his brother stopped playing around the 
	time Clay started. 
</p>

	His first professional gig came twelve years later at Dollywood
	theme park where he spent the summer performing with the group
	True Blue. In July of '92 Clay left Dollywood to return to Ohio.
	He was working in construction, when Ricky Skaggs called and asked
	him to fill the guitar slot for Kentucky Thunder. Oddly enough,
	Clay had just about quit playing between his time at Dollywood
	and Ricky's call. He spent the next three years performing with
	Kentucky Thunder. While Clay was part of the band, the IBMA 
	(International Bluegrass Music Association) awarded Kentucky Thunder
	their Instrumental Band of the Year Award for both 1999 and 2000.
	Clay was also awarded a Grammy for his participation in Soldier of
	the Cross by Ricky Skaggs &amp; Kentucky Thunder. 
</p>

<p>
	Though Clay largely considers himself a bluegrass player, his
	influence's do range outside of bluegrass and include players such
	as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Charlie Parker and Leon Rhodes. 
</p>

<p>
  A recent accomplishment for Clay has been the creation of the Clay
  Hess D-18 signature model guitars by CF Martin.

<h3><a name="grier">David Grier</a></h3>
<p>
  <img src="images/grier.jpg" height="160px" width="120px" />
	The most award-winning guitarist in recent memory is
	David Grier. For the past several years, he has been voted
	by the members of the International Bluegrass Music
	Association as Best Guitar Player of the Year. He has also
	appeared on two Grammy- winning recordings: "True Life
	Blues-A Tribute to Bill Monroe" and "The Great Dobro
	Sessions." David is also included in the book, "1,000 Great
	Guitarists." His inspiration to learn guitar came from
	exposure to Bill Monroe while his father, Lamar Grier,
	played banjo for the Blue Grass Boys in the middle 1960s. 
</p>

<p>

	David's first solo recording "Freewheeling" appeared on
	Rounder Records, as did his acclaimed 1991 duet project
	"Climbing the Walls" with mandolinist Mike Compton. David's
	"Lone Soldier" project is listed in Acoustic Guitar Magazine's
	"100 Essential Acoustic Guitar Recordings of All Time." His
	most recent solo release is "I've Got the House to Myself."
	His work is also captured on a Homespun video called 
	"Building Powerful Solos." In addition to touring solo,
	David also appears as the guitarist for Psychograss, who are
	currently celebrating a critically acclaimed new album, "Now
	Hear This".
